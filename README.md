# Continuo

**Continuo** is a *rule-based Instagram follower lead delivery system* designed for **compliance**, **data quality**, and **best-effort delivery**.

It focuses on extracting and delivering **public Instagram follower leads** in a structured, verifiable, and compliance-aware way — without automation, private data access, or outbound messaging.

---

## What Continuo does

Continuo is built to **deliver Instagram follower leads**, not to automate marketing actions.

It:
- Extracts **public Instagram follower leads** based on explicit rules
- Normalizes and deduplicates contact data
- Applies quality and structure checks
- Delivers leads via **CSV export** or **CRM integration**
- Operates under a **best-effort delivery model**

These constraints are intentional.

---

## What Continuo does NOT do

Continuo does **not**:
- Send messages or DMs
- Automate outreach or engagement
- Scrape private or restricted data
- Bypass platform protections
- Guarantee conversions, replies, or sales outcomes

The separation between **data delivery** and **marketing execution** is a core design principle.

## Core concepts

### Instagram follower leads
Contacts derived exclusively from **public Instagram follower data** of selected profiles, filtered and structured according to predefined rules.

### Rule-based extraction
Lead delivery is governed by explicit filters, exclusions, and limits — not black-box automation.

### Best-effort delivery
Continuo commits to structured delivery and data quality, not to guaranteed marketing results.

### Compliance-first design
The system avoids private data access, credential usage, and automated messaging by design.

## Compliance & data handling

Continuo is designed to operate within a **compliance-first framework**:

- Uses only publicly accessible information
- Does not store credentials or access private accounts
- Does not perform automated actions on third-party platforms

Users remain responsible for:
- How delivered leads are used
- Ensuring downstream outreach complies with applicable regulations (e.g. GDPR, ePrivacy)

## Delivery formats

Leads can be delivered as:
- Structured CSV files
- Direct CRM ingestion (depending on configuration)

Each delivery includes:
- Deduplicated entries
- Normalized fields
- Clear volume definitions

---

## Pricing model (overview)

Continuo uses a **per-lead pricing model**, with unit pricing defined in advance.

Pricing depends on:

No subscription is required for basic delivery.

## Typical use cases

Continuo is commonly used by:
- Agencies requiring raw Instagram follower leads

It is **not** intended as a replacement for advertising platforms or messaging tools.

It is a **controlled data delivery system** for teams that value:
- Clear rules over automation
- Data quality over inflated volumes
- Compliance over short-term tactics
